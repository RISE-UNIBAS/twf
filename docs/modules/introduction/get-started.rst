Get Started
===========
TWF is a web service and thus needs to be installed on a machine in the internet to utilize its multi-user capabilities.
If you have access to a TWF instance, you can get started by following these steps:

Setup Project
-------------
You will need a user account to access TWF and either you or someone else with administrator privileges will need to
create a project for you. Once you have a project, you can start by entering your credentials for Transkribus and
request an export of your data.

Once the export is complete, you can download the data into TWF and start working with it.

Have an administrator add user accounts for your team members and assign them to the project.
This will allow them to access the project and work with the data; you can also assign roles to users
to control their access.

Next Steps
----------
Once you have your project set up and your team members added, you can start working with the data.
