TWF - Transkribus Workflow
==========================

TWF, or Transkribus Workflow, is a web service designed to streamline
the process of working with data from Transkribus, an OCR service, and other digital
collections. TWF simplifies and automates several key steps, allowing researchers
to focus on data analysis rather than data management.

The TWF workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Setup Project**
    - *Connect to Transkribus*
    - *Download a Collection to the TWF server*
    - *Unpack and structure the data into a database*

2. **Review Project**
    - *Search and filter documents*
    - *Query AI models for document analysis*

3. **Manage Metadata and Dictionaries**
    - *Create and manage metadata for documents and pages*
    - *Create and manage dictionaries for tag normalization*
    - *Use external services for metadata enrichment*

4. **Create and Review Collections**
    - *Create collections of documents, pages, annotations*
    - *Review and manage collections*

5. **Export Data**
    - *Export data in various formats*
    - *Export data to external services*
    - *Export data to FAIr Repositories*

Target Audience
---------------
The primary users of TWF are:

1. **Research Groups**: TWF is designed to make it easier for research groups to work with
   Transkribus data. By automating several steps in the export process, TWF allows research
   groups to focus more on their research and less on the logistics of obtaining and preparing data.

2. **University Infrastructure Service Groups**: TWF needs to be installed on a machine in the
   internet to utilize its multi-user capabilities. As such, it is also aimed at university
   infrastructure service groups, such as digital humanities labs, who can host the service.

In summary, TWF serves a dual role: it is hosted by university infrastructure service groups and
used by research groups for their projects. This collaboration allows for efficient use of resources
and enhances the research capabilities of the groups involved.

TWF is not affiliated with Transkribus or any other of the services it connects to. It is an
independent project developed by RISE, the Research & Infrastructure Support for the Humanities
at the University of Basel.
