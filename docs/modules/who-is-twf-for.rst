Who is TWF for?
===============

TWF, or Transkribus Workflow, is a webservice designed to streamline the process of working with
Transkribus exports. It is primarily aimed at research groups who use Transkribus for their research
projects.

Target Users
------------

The primary users of TWF are:

1. **Research Groups**: TWF is designed to make it easier for research groups to work with
   Transkribus data. By automating several steps in the export process, TWF allows research
   groups to focus more on their research and less on the logistics of obtaining and preparing data.

2. **University Infrastructure Service Groups**: TWF needs to be installed on a machine in the
   internet to utilize its multi-user capabilities. As such, it is also aimed at university
   infrastructure service groups, such as digital humanities labs, who can host the service.

In summary, TWF serves a dual role: it is hosted by university infrastructure service groups and
used by research groups for their projects. This collaboration allows for efficient use of resources
and enhances the research capabilities of the groups involved.
