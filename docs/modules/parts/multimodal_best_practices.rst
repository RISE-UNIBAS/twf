Multimodal Best Practices
======================

This guide provides best practices for effectively using the multimodal functionality in TWF to get the best results when combining text and images.

Prompt Engineering
----------------

Effective Prompt Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structure your prompts for optimal multimodal performance:

1. **Start with context**: Explain what types of documents/images you're providing
2. **Be specific**: Clearly state what you want the AI to analyze
3. **Break into sections**: Organize complex requests into clearly defined sections
4. **Request structured output**: Ask for organized responses (lists, tables, etc.)

Example of a well-structured prompt:

```
I'm providing pages from a 19th century trade ledger with handwritten entries.

Please analyze these documents as follows:

PART 1: Document Structure
- Identify column headers and their meaning
- Note any special marks or annotations
- Describe the overall organization system

PART 2: Content Extraction
- Extract dates, amounts, and transaction descriptions
- Format the extracted data in a table
- Note any unusual entries or patterns

PART 3: Historical Context
- Based on the content, suggest the likely industry or business type
- Identify any historical references that help date the document
- Note any unusual terminology or abbreviations specific to this period

Return your analysis in clearly labeled sections.
```

Provider-Specific Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimize prompts for specific AI providers:

**OpenAI GPT-4 Vision**:
- More responsive to detailed instructions within the prompt
- Benefits from step-by-step analysis instructions
- Handles multiple images with explicit numbering/referencing

**Claude**:
- Excels with clear system prompts that establish expertise
- Benefits from examples of desired output format
- Responds well to requests for reasoning about confidence levels

**Gemini**:
- Strong with visual recognition tasks
- Works best with concise, clear instructions
- Excellent at identifying visual patterns across multiple images

**Mistral**:
- More limited multimodal capabilities
- Works best with simpler, more focused requests
- May need more explicit directions about image content

Image Selection
-------------

Optimizing Image Quality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select and optimize images for the best results:

1. **Resolution**: Use sufficiently high resolution for text recognition (at least 300 DPI)
2. **Clarity**: Choose clear, well-lit images without significant distortion
3. **Crop appropriately**: Remove irrelevant margins or content
4. **Balance**: Find the right balance between image quality and file size
5. **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast, especially for handwritten text

Scaling Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using image scaling:

1. **Text-heavy documents**: Maintain at least 50% scale to preserve text readability
2. **Visual analysis**: Can often use more aggressive scaling (25-30%)
3. **Mixed content**: Err on the side of higher resolution (75%)
4. **Consider provider limits**: Scale more aggressively for providers with stricter token limits
5. **Maintain aspect ratio**: Always maintain the original aspect ratio when scaling

Strategic Document Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When working with multiple documents:

1. **Diversity**: Select a representative sample that covers different document types
2. **Key pages**: Prioritize pages with the most relevant information
3. **Context pages**: Include pages that provide context (e.g., title pages, headers)
4. **Balanced approach**: Mix both text-heavy and visual-rich pages
5. **Sequential consideration**: For narrative documents, include sequential pages

Workflow Optimization
------------------

Multi-Stage Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For complex document analysis, use a multi-stage approach:

1. **Initial scan**: Use Images-only mode for a quick visual assessment
2. **Focused analysis**: Follow up with Text+Images mode for detailed analysis
3. **Specialized queries**: Create targeted follow-up queries for specific elements
4. **Synthesis**: Combine findings from multiple queries

Example multi-stage workflow:

```
Stage 1: Initial assessment
- Use Images-only mode
- Simple prompt: "Describe the main contents and structure of these documents"

Stage 2: Detailed analysis
- Use Text+Images mode
- Detailed prompt focusing on specific elements identified in Stage 1

Stage 3: Specialized extraction
- Use Text+Images mode
- Targeted prompt for extracting specific data types

Stage 4: Cross-document synthesis
- Use Text-only mode
- Provide the results from previous stages and ask for synthesis
```

Provider Combination Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Strategically combine different AI providers:

1. **Visual recognition**: Use Gemini for initial visual assessment
2. **Detailed analysis**: Use Claude for thorough, thoughtful analysis
3. **Complex extraction**: Use GPT-4 Vision for complex text+image tasks
4. **Cross-validation**: Use multiple providers and compare results for critical analyses
5. **Cost optimization**: Use less expensive providers for initial scans, premium providers for final analysis

Performance Optimization
---------------------

Reducing Token Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimize token usage to reduce costs and improve performance:

1. **Image scaling**: Always scale images appropriately (typically 50% is sufficient)
2. **Image selection**: Limit to truly necessary images (3-5 maximum for most cases)
3. **Prompt efficiency**: Keep prompts concise and focused
4. **Progressive detail**: Start with general queries, then get more specific
5. **Batching**: Process similar documents together to leverage context

Response Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get better formatted and more useful responses:

1. **Output templates**: Include examples of your desired output format
2. **Numbered instructions**: Number your questions/requests for clearer responses
3. **Confidence indicators**: Ask the AI to indicate its confidence level for each conclusion
4. **Reasoning requests**: Ask for the visual cues that led to specific conclusions
5. **Format specification**: Explicitly request markdown, tables, or other formatting

Example response optimization prompt:

```
For each document image, provide your analysis in this format:

## Document [Number]
- **Type**: [document type]
- **Date**: [estimated date] (Confidence: High/Medium/Low)
- **Key Entities**: [list of names, organizations]
- **Summary**: [2-3 sentence summary]

### Visual Elements
- [list key visual elements]

### Transcription
```markdown
[transcription of key text]
```

### Notes
- [any special observations]
```

Case-Specific Best Practices
--------------------------

Handwritten Document Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For handwritten documents:

1. **Provider selection**: Claude and GPT-4 Vision generally perform best on handwriting
2. **Context provision**: Provide information about the time period and document type
3. **Image quality**: Higher resolution (minimal scaling) is crucial
4. **Segmentation**: Ask the AI to analyze different handwriting styles separately
5. **Confidence marking**: Request marking of uncertain transcriptions with brackets

Historical Document Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For historical documents:

1. **Period context**: Include the approximate time period in your prompt
2. **Terminology assistance**: Provide contemporaneous terminology if known
3. **Template recognition**: Ask the AI to identify common document templates of the era
4. **Cultural context**: Request historical/cultural context for document elements
5. **Abbreviation expansion**: Specifically request expansion of period-specific abbreviations

Technical Document Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For technical documents:

1. **Domain specification**: Clearly specify the technical domain
2. **Diagram focus**: Request specific attention to diagrams and technical illustrations
3. **Specialized vocabulary**: Ask for definitions of domain-specific terms
4. **Explicit relationships**: Request identification of relationships between text and diagrams
5. **Standards identification**: Ask the AI to identify technical standards referenced

Measuring and Improving Results
----------------------------

Quality Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assess the quality of multimodal analyses:

1. **Ground truth comparison**: Compare AI results with known ground truth for a sample
2. **Cross-provider validation**: Compare results across different AI providers
3. **Confidence scoring**: Have the AI provide confidence scores for its conclusions
4. **Human validation**: Establish a process for human review of critical AI interpretations
5. **Consistency checks**: Look for internal consistency in the AI's analysis

Iterative Improvement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Continuously improve your multimodal prompts:

1. **Prompt versioning**: Keep track of different prompt versions and their results
2. **A/B testing**: Test different prompt formulations on the same documents
3. **Focused refinement**: Iteratively refine prompts based on specific quality issues
4. **Feedback loop**: Incorporate human feedback into prompt improvements
5. **Template development**: Create specialized templates for different document types
