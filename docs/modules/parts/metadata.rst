Metadata
========

The **Metadata** section allows users to manage additional data associated with the core documents, which
can include information imported from sources like Transkribus or PAGE.XML files. Metadata can be applied
to the project, individual documents, and pages, providing context, categorization, and authorization data
that supports analysis and retrieval.

Sections
--------

Metadata Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Overview**: Displays a summary of metadata usage within the project, including the number of documents
  and pages with associated metadata. This section provides an overview of the extent of metadata coverage,
  aiding users in tracking metadata application across the project.

Load Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section provides options for importing metadata into the project:

- **Load JSON Metadata**: Allows users to import metadata from JSON files, enabling bulk uploads of data that
  supplement core documents and pages.

- **Load Google Sheets Metadata**: Supports importing metadata from Google Sheets, which allows collaborative
  updates and editing before data is incorporated into the project. (Support for CSV imports is planned for
  future releases.)

Metadata Workflows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Metadata workflows facilitate various processes for organizing and controlling metadata:

- **Extract Controlled Values**: Extracts controlled values from metadata fields, helping to standardize and
  validate data entries according to predefined categories or vocabularies.

- **Review Document Metadata**: Allows users to review metadata applied at the document level, making it
  easier to check, validate, and refine metadata entries for individual documents.

- **Review Page Metadata**: Provides tools to review and manage metadata applied at the page level, ensuring
  that each page's metadata is complete, consistent, and accurate.

Metadata Overview Statistics
----------------------------

The **Metadata Overview** section displays key statistics on metadata coverage within the project:

- **Documents with Metadata**: Shows the total number of documents that have associated metadata, giving a
  sense of how extensively metadata is used across documents.

- **Pages with Metadata**: Indicates the total number of pages with associated metadata, helping users
  understand the depth of metadata application at the page level.

This metadata management system allows users to enrich their research data, providing additional context,
classification, and connections across documents and pages for enhanced analytical capability.
