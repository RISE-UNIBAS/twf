                    TWF is a tool designed for managing and enriching document-based projects. 
                    It allows users to import large sets of documents, such as those from Transkribus or 
                    PAGE.XML formats, and enhance them with additional metadata, tags, and dictionary 
                    entries. You can browse, search, and organize documents, apply metadata, and 
                    create structured collections for export.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tool supports importing data from various formats, managing complex metadata, 
                    and grouping information into meaningful dictionaries. Once your data is organized, 
                    you can export it in customizable formats, such as JSON, for further use in other 
                    systems or analysis environments.
