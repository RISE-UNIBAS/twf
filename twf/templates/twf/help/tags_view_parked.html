    <h2>Parked Tags</h2>
    <p>
        This page shows all tags that have been marked as "parked" - meaning they have been set aside temporarily without 
        being resolved. Parked tags are those that you've decided to handle later for various reasons.
    </p>

    <h3>What are Parked Tags?</h3>
    <p>
        Parked tags are a special status for tags that:

        <li>Cannot be immediately resolved due to missing information</li>
        <li>Are waiting for a decision from another team member</li>
        <li>Are temporarily set aside to focus on higher-priority tags</li>
    </ul>
