<h1>Task Monitor</h1>
<p>
    The Task Monitor provides a centralized dashboard to track and manage all tasks running in your project.
    Tasks are operations which might take a longer time to complete, such as AI processing, or manual tasks that are
    performed by users. The Task Monitor allows you to monitor the status of these tasks.
</p>

<h2>Task Monitor Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-time Status:</strong> View the current status of each task (pending, running, completed, failed).</li>
    <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> See detailed progress bars for long-running tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Task Details:</strong> View information about each task, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Task type and description</li>
            <li>Start and estimated completion time</li>
            <li>User who initiated the task</li>
            <li>Resources being used</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Task Management:</strong> Cancel running tasks or remove completed ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task Types</h2>
<p>
    The Task Monitor tracks various background operations, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data import and export processes</li>
    <li>AI batch processing operations</li>
    <li>Dictionary enrichment tasks</li>
    <li>Tag extraction and normalization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task Actions</h2>
<p>
    From the Task Monitor, you can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Filter Tasks:</strong> Use the search and filter options to find specific tasks or task types. This only affects the display and doesn't change any tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancel Tasks:</strong> Stop a running task that is no longer needed or is consuming too many resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove Tasks:</strong> Clear completed or failed tasks from the list. This only removes the task entry from the monitor and does not undo any work the task has already performed.</li>
    <li><strong>View Details:</strong> Get more information about a specific task, including any error messages for failed tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task Statuses</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Task is queued but not yet running.</li>
    <li><strong>Running:</strong> Task is currently being executed.</li>
    <li><strong>Completed:</strong> Task has finished successfully.</li>
    <li><strong>Failed:</strong> Task encountered an error and could not complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Cancelled:</strong> Task was manually stopped before completion.</li>
</ul>
