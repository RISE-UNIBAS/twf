    The project task monitor shows the progress of the tasks in the project. You can see the status of the tasks and the
    user who is working on the task. You can also see the progress of the task in the progress bar.

<p><strong>Filtering Tasks</strong> allows you to search for certain task. This is only a display function.</p>
<p><strong>Removing tasks</strong> will not remove the tasks workload but only its documentation. You can generate
a project documentation with these infos.</p>
