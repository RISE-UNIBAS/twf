<h1>Context Help: General Project Settings</h1>
<p>The General Settings page allows you to configure the basic information and properties of your project. These settings determine how your project appears, who can access it, and what dictionaries are associated with it.</p>

<h4>Project Information</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title:</strong> The name of your project. This title will be displayed throughout the application and should be descriptive and recognizable.</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A detailed explanation of your project's purpose, contents, and goals. A good description helps team members understand the project's context and objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Access Control</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Owner:</strong> The primary administrator of the project. The owner has full rights to modify all aspects of the project, including settings, data, and user access.</li>
    <li><strong>Members:</strong> Users who have access to work with the project. You can add multiple members by selecting them from the dropdown list. Members will have access based on their assigned permissions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Resource Settings</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Selected Dictionaries:</strong> The dictionaries associated with this project for normalization and entity recognition. You can select multiple dictionaries to use for various types of entities (persons, places, organizations, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Save Changes</h4>
<p>Click the <strong>"Save Settings"</strong> button at the bottom of the form to apply your changes. If you navigate away without saving, your changes will be lost.</p>

<h4>Tips for Effective Settings</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Choose a clear, descriptive project title that reflects the content and purpose.</li>
    <li>Write a comprehensive description that helps new members understand the project.</li>
    <li>Carefully select the owner and members to ensure proper access control.</li>
    <li>Select only the dictionaries that are relevant to your project to avoid clutter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changes to project settings may affect how data is displayed and processed throughout the application. Review your settings carefully before saving.</p>
