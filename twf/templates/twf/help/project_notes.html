    <h2>Project Notes</h2>
    <p>
        The Project Notes feature allows you to create, manage, and share important notes related to your project. Notes are a convenient way to document decisions, record important information, and communicate with team members.
    </p>

    <h3>Notes Overview</h3>
    <p>
        On this page, you can:

        <li>Access detailed views of individual notes</li>
        <li>Create new notes to share information with your team</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes Table</h3>
    <p>
        The main section of the page displays a table of all notes in your project. For each note, you can see:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title:</strong> The note's title, which serves as a quick reference</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Filtering Notes</h3>
    <p>
        Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow down the list of notes. You can filter by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title:</strong> Find notes containing specific text in their titles</li>
        <li><strong>Creator:</strong> Show notes created by a specific team member</li>
        <li><strong>Date Range:</strong> Display notes created or modified within a certain timeframe</li>

        After setting your filters, the table will update to show only the matching notes, with a count of how many notes were found.
    </p>
