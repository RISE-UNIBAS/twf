    You are about to use a batch operation which will try to find authorization data for all entries in the selected
    dictionary. This operation can take a long time depending on the number of entries in the dictionary. Please note
    that you might need to set credentials (API keys, usernames, etc.) in the project settings before you can use
    this feature.<br/>
    <strong>How it works</strong>: Batches take the labels of dictionary entries as input and try to find authorization 
      data. Format your entries accordingly.
