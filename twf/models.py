"""This module contains the models for the twf app. The models are used to store data in the database.
Each module class represents a table in the database. The classes are subclasses of Django's models.Model class.

The main model is the Project model, which represents a project in the app. Most other models rely directly or
indirectly on the Project model. Most models extend the TimeStampedModel class, which provides self-updating
'created' and 'modified' fields. This means, every time an object is created or modified, the 'created_at' and
'modified_at' fields are updated automatically, but the user who created or modified the object must be provided.
